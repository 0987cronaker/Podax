Podax is a podcast downloader and player. It is heavily modeled after Google Listen, which is no longer in development.

Features include:

- keeping a list of subscriptions
- downloading new podcasts when they are available
- a widget for easy pausing and resuming
- open source development at [Github](https://www.github.com/thasmin/Podax)
- variable speed playback

Building Podax
==============

It's highly recommended to use Android Studio and gradle to build Podax. Simply open the project file and compile.
If you're using a branch with native code, you'll need to download the NDK and run ndk-build manually until the gradle plugin is fixed.
