Podax is a podcast downloader and player. It is heavily modeled after Google Listen, which is no longer in development.

Features include:

- keeping a list of subscriptions
- downloading new podcasts when they are available
- importing subscriptions from Google Reader
- a widget for easy pausing and resuming
- open source development at [Github](https://www.github.com/thasmin/Podax)

The current version of Podax is 0.8 alpha with one bug remaining before 0.9 beta. Then the focus will be on stability before releasing 1.0.
